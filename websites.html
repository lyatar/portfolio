                People who are stressed use stress wearables to track their stress, but many of these are seen as being kind of nerdy and are highly obvious. They don't attract people who aren't into tech or health. My mission was to design both a wearable and matching UI that would turn stress into something positive. Can you re:set your stress levels?

    My first foray into UX was through designing web sites such as my personal blog layouts using simple html, css, and photoshop. Here's a quick snapshot of some websites I have designed.

        This hi-fidelity prototype was created using only CSS3 and HTML5 from the ground up (no bootstrap, etc). This was a group project where each member was in charge of a different page, but cohesion was necessary. Some of the key points to this design are:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The listing information was arranged into a table to make it easier to look at listings. </li>
            <li>To look through the listing faster, when a user hovers over the description, an extended caption of the listing along with a picture is shown, so the user can stay on the same page longer before she commits.</li>
            <li>Reorganized the filters for listing to make it more clear what the filters are. More advanced options are hidden.</li>
            <li>A map that you can zoom in and out of was created to make it easier to where the listing is located</li>

            I was in charge of designing and managing this website for a year. It can only be remembered through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210064935/http://fusion.zotters.org/home">wayback machine</a>. <br><br>The visual design was redesigned completely from the previous website.
            <br><br>
            Design Decisions<br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hierarchy of information was important.</b></li>
                <li>The website link was on a flyer, but what we really want first timers to see is the are the club videos. Due to technical restrictions, a streaming video right on the website was not possible, it was decided to use screenshots that would let the user know that they were on fusions website, but also be a little funny to peak their interest so that they would watch the videos.</li>
                <li>The second most important piece of information was Membership which is why it is the second fold.</li>
                <li>Third are the updates of what event is happening next or a recap. The website acts mostly like a feed for information about the club.</li>
                <li>In addition, all of the other pages on the website were redone, such as the about, activities. This information is clearly articulated at the top for easy access. I had the ability to chose what content to add or remove. I chose to put the information most important for potential new members. </li>
                <li><b>Overall, the site aimed to be easy for potential members to find out what we were like.</b></li>
            </ul>

            Why the change? <br><br>The focus of the website was no longer about recruiting, but about sharing information. As we were a tech-savvy club with a twitter, it would be cool to show our twitter tweets on our webpage. Adding a side navigation bar on the left allowed for more information to be shown on the website at once, so the website was a one-stop hub for club information.
