            I spent a summer as a <span class="highlight">consulting intern</span> at HOK. Their work deals with architectural programming. My role was to work under a more senior team member to conduct research, organize materials, support project findings, maintain project files, and produce reports.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-text">
            I helped conduct project research such as info on clients and assisted in putting together Consulting deliverables. I collected space utilization information from AutoCad drawings. And I processed quantitative and qualitative information from clients (such as surveys). In addition, I went on site to conduct field studies.

        "Problem Seeking"
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        The theory behind and the guide behind the work the team does is based off of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Seeking-Architectural-Programming-Primer/dp/1118084144/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=4KFSH4H810FKG7J30N64">Problem Seeking by William Pena</a>. It's basically a guideline of how architects can work with their clients. One of the main differences between UX approaches and Pena's problem seeking approach is that problem seeking requires a distinct separation between programming and design. He believes that before a solution can be made, you need to know what your questions are first (a more waterfall approach than agile). He argues that solutions can only be partial and immature if the problem is not fully laid out.

        Architectural Programming is a Process

    <div class="clear">
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        There are 5 steps to the process. <br><br>
        1. Establish goals <br><br>
        2. Collect and analyze facts <br><br>
        3. Uncover and test concepts <br><br>
        4. Determine needs <br><br>
        5. State the problem. <br><br>

        What kinds of questions are we asking with each of these steps?

    <div class="paragraph-text">
        1. What does the client want to achieve, and Why? <br><br>
        2. What do we know? What is given?<br><br>
        3. How does the client want to achieve the goals? <br><br>
        4. How much money and space? What level of quality? <br><br>
        5. What are the significant conditions affecting the deisgn of the building? What are the general directions the design should take? <br><br>

        Field Studies
    </div>
    <div class="clear">
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        The highlight of my internship was when I conducted two week-long observation studies at two different on-site locations and assisted in the preparation of these studies. Since I participated in two observation studies, I was able to compare and contrast the differences between the two companies since the studies had the same "template." From this experience, I received my first glimpse into how design research in industry works and saw how my seniors interacted with clients. I also saw how deliverables came together. I learned the most from the observation studies as it helped me begin to think about things I don't normally think about. We usually think people spend a lot of time at their desks, but research showed that they may spend a lot of time in small group meetings at other people's desks.
