                    The theory behind and the guide behind the work the team does is based off of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Seeking-Architectural-Programming-Primer/dp/1118084144/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=4KFSH4H810FKG7J30N64">Problem Seeking by William Pena</a>. It's basically a guideline of how architects can work with their clients. One of the main differences between UX approaches and Pena's problem seeking approach is that problem seeking requires a distinct separation between programming and design. He believes that before a solution can be made, you need to know what your questions are first (a more waterfall approach than agile). He argues that solutions can only be partial and immature if the problem is not fully laid out.

        As an intern, I had two roles, one was to assist organizing the information collected from vision sessions with clients, surveys, etc into reports. The other role was with setting up how the on-site observation studies would be run, such as mapping out the routes beforehand, creating the spreadsheets to be used to collect information, loading the information onto ipads, and checking if employees were sitting where hr mapped where they were sitting (this was important so we could category based of off their department).    </div>

        I worked on two observation studies that both had similar procedures. One was at Corporate Client based in Utah and the other was a Biotech Client based in Sunnyvale. Both of the clients were moving into new buildings and needed some help with the programming of the new spaces. Prior to when I came on team, the team conducted visioning sessions with different stakeholders to brainstorm goals for the new building and their brand. While I was on site doing observation studies, other team members were in meetings with different groups and departments.

        Does your HR keep track of where you sit? Does your company have a current plan of your building? In many cases, these change and aren't updated. Also the technology used to keep track can vary. In one of the cases, not everyone had to be observed, so it was important to make sure that the names of the people on those lists were listed on the plan.
        <br><br>
        The above plan is an example of how I annotated the map. Prior, I had to check to make sure the people to be observed were on list of people to be observed. This was how we were scoping out and planning the how the field study would work.

        To collect data, we also needed to know what to collect. In general, the goal to get an idea of what the habits of employees were like. Criteria was generally based on previous field studies that were conducted. Some of the things we looked at were the space type such as if the person was in a cube or an office. It was a way to see if people needed more offices. In addition, we looked to see when the space was occupied and if there were meetings. Some places have unused meeting rooms. It's also important to see what kind of tasks people were doing such as are they more likely to be taking calls or crunching numbers. I was in charge of creating these spreadsheets and loading them onto ipads. We also had paper forms just incase. This format made it so that we could send the spreadsheet immediately after each hour of study and it could be analyzed by an analyst on our team.

        The observers carried ipads and annotated maps of the site (like the maps shown above). However, not everything goes as planned and it was important to be able to change and adjust the original plans to match what the site is really like. Employees are anonymized in the actual analysis of the information, but for locating where you were on the map, it was important to also look for name tags or other indications that you were really in the right area. The information on the spreadsheet collected the quantitative information about how the space was used. The image below shows rough notes about the spaces so we wouldn't mark a cube for storage as a person!

        In addition to the spreadsheet data, we also took an anthropological approach on the space and noted some habits. Below are just some rough observations:
        <br><br>
        <!-- FIX SYNTAX -->
        <u><b>July 19th Observations:</u></b><br>
        9AM Observations:<br>
        <li>In the “construction zone”/ empty space area, people still stand to chat about work. </lI>
        <li>Coffee Area is used, people casually chatting</lI>
        10 AM<br>
        <li>One thing our study does not account for is when people chat in between cubes. Because of their close proximity to one another, it’s easy for coworkers to ask other coworkers general questions while they sit at their desk. <br></lI>
        <li>The breakroom can be used for a phone call when the workplace is too busy. Break room used for discussions (2 people)<br></lI>
        <li>People are coming in and out of this building. <br>
        <li>Is it difficult to take phone calls in the general work area? People take calls in the break room or outside or in the hallways.<br>
        11 AM<br>
        <li>In the construction area, groups of people congregated (usually small groups of 2). They seemed to have come from a meeting and were just catching up to confirm some things. <br>
        <li>When there are events in the main forum conference room, they seem to get stuff catered and food is left in the kitchen. <br>

        As an architecture student, it left me with a better understanding of how people really use buildings.
    </div>
    <div class="clear">
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        In architecture studios, you design buildings and sometimes you might feel disconnected from the fact that people actually use your buildings. You add an entourage person to match how you envision would use your space, but the reality is the spaces will constantly change. It's interesting how spaces aren't used how you want them to be used but you can also see how placing people by other people can cause unexpected issues. Having people in cubicles that talk to a lot of customers on the phone next to another person that does the same thing can make it such at that one of them has to take their calls outside because the office is too loud. In addition, you can see how different departments have different needs.

    <div class="header-text">
        Field Studies can provide quantitative and qualitative data about how people are using space, but how do people really view their space?
    </div>
    <div class="clear">
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        How people use their space versus what they think about their space can be different. Before I came onto the team, a lot of the early sessions of meeting with employees and discussing what kinds of spaces they would like were already completed, but I was presented with the task of organizing the information (because there was a lot of different voices and opinions!) into something more coherent. <br><br>
        One of the things I worked on was looking at surveys and grouping the information into different themes.
        <img src="assets/img/map5.jpg"  class ="diagram">
        <div class="clear"></div><br><br>
        These are examples of how I initially began to organize some of the survey data by first tallying out what were some of the most common topics. This information was later put together and further cleaned for the final deliverable for the client.<br><br>

        Conclusion? People want their privacy when they need it, but they also want to be close to their own departments.

        This experience introduced me to what information you might need to run a field study and how to go about running a field study. Field studies are interesting not only because of the data you collect, but to also consider your role as a researcher on site. In some cases, employees might not really have an idea who you are or why they're seeing you every house (even though there's a sign on their department's door about the study). It brings up an interesting point of the role of the researcher. At the beginning, people are curious about your role, but by Friday, they're used to you.

        In the end, it's all about the user!
    </div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        Most importantly, I learned about the user and what they really want in a building. This was fairly different from my architecture studio experiences where we do site analysis but we don't really look at the users other than their demographics. We craft in our mind who might use the building based off of what stores and buildings are already on site, but we have the actual data from the community. <br><br>
        I discovered the importance of <span class="highlight">real user data</span>. This experience sparked a greater interest in data because <span class="highlight">I could no longer see a design suitable unless I understood the context</span>.
