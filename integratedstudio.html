                People who are stressed use stress wearables to track their stress, but many of these are seen as being kind of nerdy and are highly obvious. They don't attract people who aren't into tech or health. My mission was to design both a wearable and matching UI that would turn stress into something positive. Can you re:set your stress levels?

            Concept

    <div class="paragraph-text">
        <br>
        This building is organized in such a manner that the workers, those who work in the kitchens and in the farms, are able to access the urban space easily to distribute their products, but at the same time, the spaces are not easily accessible to the public because it would be quite difficult to be producing five hundred pastries while curious customers are zooming around in your space. To make this happen, circulation is pushed to towards the back, near the east, while there are two entrances for customers, one in the west and one south. Customers circulate in a circular manner around the food booths like a cafeteria line with seating on the outskirts. While the overall building favors the west as a front, at the ground level, both entrances have an equal importance – food booths face the west and the information desk greets the south. Since the shops are temporary, the column grid acts as a grid marking, so that shops can know the coordinates of where they are positioned. Everything can change and even the panelized system can eventually be rearranged. The absence of cladding signifies where windows and doors are, but this holds no permanence. Everyone is just a tenant of this building and holds no ownership.
