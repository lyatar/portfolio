        <div class="title-text"> Is there an easier way to look at climate data?</div>
        <div class="body-text">
            Building scientists and architects use weather data collected from weather towers to inform their designs. Having knowledge of the climate can reduce energy loads and making it easier to employ passive designs. Climate information is readily available as epw files (which is like a big spreadsheet of different environmental factors for a site). Usually different software is needed to visualize these different points, but even the visualizations can be difficult for people in the field to understand, sometimes requiring 20 page articles about how to read a chart. How much more for a student?

        <div class="paragraph-text">
            The <span class="highlight">main goal </span>of this project is to develop a tool for building scientists, architects, and architecture students that can easily describe what a climate is like. This project combines all of my interests, architecture, data, programming, and ui/ux.
            <!-- In some ways it can be seen as a <span class="highlight">data visualization</span> project. This final prototype was developed by me using <span class="highlight">d3.js, html, and css</span> and was created in 10 weeks. To parse the information, it used the dY javascript plugin library. -->

        <div class="body-text">
            Twitter-sentiment analysis is both qualitative and quantitative. I've spent about a year slowly diving into twitter sentiment analysis from using online sites that showed maps of where tweets were located to learning how to scrap my own twitters and diving into the digital humanities?
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-text">
            Why? Because I wanted to see what information we could really get and I wanted to see what the data could be used for (also because once upon a time I sat, read, and organized a hundred or so surveys and thought about whether using python would be more efficient (would it even be accurate?)).
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, text analysis is best for exploring data sets.

                I have degrees in Architecture, Comparative Literature, and Japanese. You might wonder how these are related to UX (or to each other), but different fields have allowed me to look at problems from different angles. All of them required proper research to back up my arguments. On the side, I've dabbled in my technical interests (web design, buying the latest programming books, dreaming of learning of signal processing, data science). I'm passionate about both design and data. And I seriously need a new picture.  <br><br>
