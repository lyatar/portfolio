                Building scientists and architects use weather data collected from weather towers to help them in their design decisions and research. This information is readily available as epw files. However as this information is vast, it is important that there are clear methods for visualizing these. Many of the visualization methods make it difficult to fully understand what the graphs are saying. Plus, they aren't the prettiest (which makes it harder to read).

                People who are stressed use stress wearables to track their stress, but many of these are seen as being kind of nerdy and are highly obvious. They don't attract people who aren't into tech or health. My mission was to design both a wearable and a matching UI that would turn stress into something positive. Can you re:set your stress levels?

                Can user-generated data such as Twitter be used as a substitute for site analysis? Questions aren't prompted and what's being tweeted is constantly changing. It's more up-to-date than a census, but it's not the whole community? The quick answer, no it can't be a substitute, but it can tell something else.

                I have degrees in Architecture, Comparative Literature, and Japanese. You might wonder how these are related to UX (or to each other), but different fields have allowed me to look at problems from different angles. All of them required proper research to back up my arguments. On the side, I've dabbled in my technical interests (web design, buying the latest programming books, dreaming of learning of signal processing, data science). I'm passionate about both design and data. And I seriously need a new picture.  <br><br>
