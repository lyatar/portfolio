        Can user-generated data such as Twitter be used as a substitute for site analysis? Questions aren't prompted and what's being tweeted is constantly changing. It's more up-to-date than a census, but it's not the whole community? The quick answer, no it can't be a substitute, but it can tell something else.
        <br><br>
        Can architecture and data be combined? How might we explore alternative ways of expressing data in a building?

         In <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Driven+Design+and+Construction%3A+25+Strategies+for+Capturing%2C+Analyzing+and+Applying+Building+Data-p-9781118898703">Data-Driven Design and Construction </a>, Randy Deutsch mentions how lots of information is geo-located. From this information we can gather what type of food people eat, how many people use a certain service, etc. The usefulness of this data is that it is immediate in comparison to the census which comes out every ten years. Though of course, there is a gap in the users as certain types of people use social media versus the census which collects data from people of all walks of life not just those with a smart phone. <br><br>

         It’s important to note that it is important to know the limitations of data and that all of these models of data mining are built with their own biases. Data cannot be the sole driver of the design process in your  project and there must be a middle ground. Therefore these tools must be adapted in a way for you to achieve what you want to achieve.

            What are some of the Basics for Text Analysis for Social Media?
        </div>
        <div class="clear">
        <div class="paragraph-text">
             H. Andrew Schwartz and Lyle H. Ungar provide an overview of the current methods of content analysis of social media in Data-Driven Content Analysis of Social Media: A Systematic Overview of Automated Methods (2015). For social scientists, they can work toward two goals: prediction and insight. They claim that “prediction focuses on automatic estimation or measurement of specific psychosocial outcomes from word use” while insight-based studies “use exploratory language analyses to better understand what drives different behavioral pattens, for example, finding topics that distinguish personality factors.” Prediction is usually done using large multivariate regression or support vector machine models while insight is done by repeated univariate or bivariate analyses that are easier to understand (like correlations).  These methods can vary from counting words in a specified word list (lexica) or other methods that generate the lexica or identify keywords that are predictive of a trait.  <br><br>
             There are both hand-driven and data-driven techniques. Hand-driven techniques tend to be “more accessible, theory-driven, abstract, and able to handle small datasets, while data-driven tend to be more transparent, capture more connections, and are able to yield unexpected associations”. Hand-driven techniques are such as manual dictionaries or crowd-sourced dictionaries which are created by people while a data-driven techniques create dictionaries and topics from the data it’s fed.
             <br><br>
             In addition, social media has many limitations such a being a biased sample (not everyone uses social media).  Furthermore, online survey matches can be biased depending on the questions. They also point out that a “deeper problem lies in any data-driven analysis: it discovers correlation, not causality.” This means that data-driven analysis can provide you possible suggestions but you have to also think about the context. The data analysis cannot give you the whole picture.
             <br><br>
             Therefore it's important to keep in mind that something may be happening, but it won’t provide the whole picture. It’ s up to the user to discover the cause and to interpret. In terms of techniques, our goal is to provide insight about the site. We will also be using hand-driven methods (dictionaries) for their transparency.

        But can user-generated data create a building?<br><br>

        <span class="highlight">The future of data in buildings can be responsive </span>- like how a sun screen for a building can adjust to the sun, a building can also adjust to user-generated data. <br><br>
        What could it look like? It could look like the above where we have a base grid-like framework of panels that can all be changed. Data would decide if a panel would be a floor, a partition or a door (or a really big window). It would require user-generated data like twitter that would then have to be parsed and translated into a number or an algorithm that the building system would understand. The build would respond to this.

    <!-- <div class="paragraph-text"> --><br><br>
        In the case of this building, it responds to positive and negative tweets (based off of a percentage). The building would be x% open as the twitter source is x% positive, unless the weather would override the conditions. If it was raining, the building would be fully shut no matter how positive the tweets were.

    <div class="header-text">
        The building would essentially be a data visualization of the community's data.
