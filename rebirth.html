        The classic example of a wearable is without a doubt the fitbit and the apple watch. They're big and clunky. Usually adopted by the tech-savvy or the health conscious.  They're also both watch-like. However, there are also other projects that attempting to be fashionable. There's "My Leaf" by Bellabeat which takes on a leaf motif (I learned about this after I decided on the leaves).

        This was a four week iterative design process. Each design iteration was completed in a weeks time and critiqued by design instructors and fellow colleagues. Based off of feedback, the design was reworked. The app requirements are laid out below:

        The first step was to gauge what might make people relax from stress.
        <br><br>
        Typically, we associated stress with heat (the color red) so the reverse would be thinking of cool temperatures. You can think of water droplets or ice as a way to cool down. However, water has another connotation - <span class="highlight">revival</span>. You can think of someone jumping out of the water and being revived or you can think of an ice phoenix having its rebirth.

        Girls who are stressed don't always need to be told to cool down. Sometimes you're stressed because you might be so swamped up in your work that you forget your real goal.

Being told you need to take deep breaths won't make you feel more calm but more stressed because now you're stressed because you're being told you're stressed and you need to calm down but now you're more stressed because you can't take calm breaths!

        A Golden Crown of Leaves for the Queen
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        <br>
    The initial idea was for the wearable to look like a golden leaf headband. It would be like a crown, so that the wearer feels like queen (and fashionable) when she wears it. It's also not that obvious it's a wearable to track stress. The stress sensor is hidden behind her ear and is encased within the headband. The main issue with the initial wearable sketch is that there is no visual indicator of how you're stressed. She would have to look at her phone or in the mirror and if she's in the zone, the stress sensor could be going off for hours and she would never know! The final wearable is has a detachable "sensor leaf" that changes colors to indicate stress.

        Two different typefaces are used on the numbers along with two different sizes. Readability was an important factor in chosing a typeface, but the text was also chosen to set the aesthetic tone for the piece because there is little text. Only one type of text-typeface is used in the piece because only one type of information is conveyed through the text.

        My final color palette deviated from the red/blue association for heat as I began to pull in elements of dark and light. A full red screen with red elements and a full blue screen with blue elements did not have enough contrast. I chose colors that were more respective of the iconography of the leaves and the final flower. The final flower is blue which is reminiscent of the original temperature inspired palette.

        Problems with Early Iterations
    </div>
    <div class="clear">
    <div class="paragraph-text">
        Version 1<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The initial idea was that the leaves were like a thermometer, but this left the leaves looking too organized when they suggested otherwise. </li>
            <li>Too much text (telling the user to do things that should be intuitive and strange words of encouragement)</li>
            <li>Strange Imagery (It looks like the person is jumping on leaves when I wanted a "ta-da" effect)</li>
            <li>It was suggested that I try building a tree with the leaves. </li>
        </uL>
        Version 2<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The screen when the user is not stressed looked more dreary than when they are stressed (the screen looked too empty)</li>
            <li>I went from too much text to too little text. I was then challenged to introduce meaningful text and to try to make it big or in the middle.</li>
            <li>There are also two different color worlds - the gray and the blue.</li>


        </ul>
        Version 3<br>
        <ul>
            <li>This design used a grid system to organize the content and I changed the colors which represented more of a light/dark instead of hot red/ cool blue.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that there are too many systems - withering leaves, sweeping leaves, ground/down. </li>
            <li>It's unclear how you pan up from the group ("two different views still - world of the leaves on the group and world of the branch"). </li>
            <li>The story telling is a little weird because you have all of these fallen and withered leaves, but they somehow return to the branch. </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="paragraph-text">
    Since, the beginning of the project, I had these fallen leaves that were spread on the ground. The stressed screen was an indicator of stress, but I also saw it as a wallpaper. It's not too intrusive that it distracts you and if someone passed by they might think something like, "oh this girl has a nice graphical wallpaper." It has some wallpaper like qualities.
    <br><br>
    One of the biggest issues with this iteration is that there is a bit of a disconnect between the stress screen and the relaxed screen. There are two different worlds, the world of the fallen leaves and the world of the tree branch with the abstract blue flower. While I saw this as two views, one as looking down and then when you relax, you can look up. There isn't a strong transitional cue as to why we're looking up a tree. How did we get there? And why are there green leaves on this tree?

        One day, Isadora found herself working at her favorite cafe.
    <br><br>
        An hour earlier at her apartment, she sprayed her favorite perfume and applied her favorite lipstick. Today was game day. It was going to be a battle. She has a major deadline to complete today, and she has always been called a work-a-holic. She's always wanted something to track her stress, but the stress-tracking bracelet her friend recommended didn't suit her style and always clashed with her outfits. She wasn't being shallow, but she wanted to feel her best when working and a tech-inspired wristband always distracted her from her work.
    <br><br>
        And then it caught her eye.
    <br><br>
        That golden leaf headband always made her feel like a queen. She reached for it from her dresser and she was off. Yep, it was a stress detector, but most people didn't know that. Most of her friends were surprised that the threads on the headband could change color and thought it was just a cool accessory.
    <br><br>
        Back at the cafe, Isadora was hard at work. She pulled out the sensor leaf and at the corner of her eye she could see a red color. It was time to monitor her stress. She pulled out her app and she could see that she had some leaves were brown. Some of her leaves were withering. She clasped the sensor leaf in her hand and her eyes fell on the the big .65 on her screen. It's ok, I got this, she told herself. My focus percentage is good and it seems like my excitement percentage is good as well (she wasn't quite sure how her excite was being measured).
    <br><br>
        An hour passed and her stress seemed to be under control, when suddenly she received a call from one of her partners. She had to redo one of the pieces. A non-existent future of regrets filled her mind. I can't-
    <br><br>
        Brown.
    <br><br>
        She was cut off. Her headband had an ugly brown leaf and her screen was full of brown leaves. It was like Fall. And like the analogy of Fall, she would fall. Ugh. In frustration, Isadora tapped the screen and the brown leaves began to slide out of the screen. And she was faced with an empty gray screen. Great, even the app froze. Isadora placed her phone on the table and slouched in her chair.
    <br><br>
        Suddenly, the screen turned a pale yellow and light blue leaves flew in from the bottom of the screen as if they were dancing. Light in the the darkness, she thought. The words re:birth started to fade in. And then she remembered. She could be revived. She could be revitalized. Like a phoenix she could have her rebirth and become better than before. After Fall and Winter came Spring. She could emerge from the darkness and come into the light. She just had to throw out the unnecessary baggage. She began to see herself in the flower that was assembling and by the time the flower animation finished and the flower was sitting firming at the bottom of the stage, she was ready to begin. She was strong. She was like a queen wearing her crown. She was <em>in charge</em>. Her focus and excitement went up and her stress was down.
    <br><br>
        10 p.m., just when the cafe was closing, she hit send. It was perfect and time flew by fast (in a good way). The leaf was a light yellowish-green. As she was packing her stuff, the barista cleaning smiled at her, she pulled her hair out of it's updo, shaking out her hair (with the pretty sensor leaf in sight) and exited stage left shining.
    <br><br>She nailed it.

    <div class="paragraph-text">
        This project taught me a lot about how to carry through and develop a concept. Since the beginning I had this idea of a leafy headband and leaves spread out on the stress-screen. I wanted to the leaves to be decorative but also a monitor and I wanted there to be a strong connection between the leaf headband and the app.
        <br><br>
            I wanted this app to turn stress into something empowering. I originally thought of power poses that induce high power. And in my first screens iterations I had a set of instructions for the user to strike a power pose and a way to stretch and refresh.
        <br><br>
            However, I ended up playing with the idea of the leaves and the narrative that could be built up with that. I discovered I was able to to convey the same message without being as literal. The goal of the app isn't to do a power pose, but for the user to be refreshed and revived.<br><br>
