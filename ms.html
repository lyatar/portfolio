                    True corresponds to positive sentiment. In general we see more positive tweets. The proportion of positive to negative aren't too drastic from one another.

                    <p>If this analysis were to be done again, it would require better cleaning of the dataset (and more machine power). But in general, I think this research was good for exploring possibilities of when people might be prompted to talk start mentioning weather. I only looked for tweets that had the word weather, but it would have been better to use a dictionary that had terms used to describe the weather. In addition, using a weighted dictionary or a better sentiment analysis would make this analysis strong.</p>
                    <p>I hope that in the future, people will continue to use text analysis as a way to categorize and bring together different disciplines because it can add more dimensions to things we don't really think much about. The weather, it's always there and always changing, but it's hard to really consciously realize that it might be what's making you feel off. There are studies that say that yes extreme weather is doing this, but they always preempt people to talk about the weather, put people in isolated case studies and also how people feel about weather is also very subjective. Therefore, it's necessary to find a way, even if it's a little messy, that can analyse and allow us to look at what we have been doing and being able to separate ourself a little (which counting words does). But ulimtately, we have to re-insert our own opinions back to think if this makes sense and ultimately, these techniques are best for exploring.</p>
